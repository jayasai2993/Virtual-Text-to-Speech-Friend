# Virtual Text-to-Speech Friend
This is a Python-based virtual friend application that uses text-to-speech (TTS) functionality to interact with users. Built with pyttsx3, this project converts text inputs to spoken words, allowing for a simple text-based conversation. The application greets the user, listens to input, and speaks responses in real-time until the user decides to exit.

Features
Real-Time Speech Conversion: Uses pyttsx3 to convert text inputs into speech.
Adjustable Speech Rate: Configured to speak at a set rate for better listening experience.
Continuous Interaction: Keeps listening to user inputs and responds until instructed to exit.
Exit Control: Typing "bye" triggers a friendly farewell message and ends the program.
